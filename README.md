# Diabetes Prediction System Project (ML)

This project focuses on the development of an advanced Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning techniques. The primary goal is to provide precise diabetes risk predictions using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface has been implemented using Streamlit, making the system accessible and valuable for informed healthcare decision support.

## Technologies Used


 - Python
 - Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
 - Web Framework: Streamlit

## Features

- Diabetes Risk Prediction: Utilizes the SVM algorithm to predict the risk of diabetes based on input features.
- Web Interface: Integrated with Streamlit for a seamless user experience, making it easy for healthcare professionals and users to interact with the system.



## Running Tests

Run the Streamlit web application:
```bash
  streamlit run Diabetes-Prediction-web-app.py
```
